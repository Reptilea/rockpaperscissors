I will be creating a simple version of rock, paper, scissors that can be played from the browser console. Later on I hope to add a functioning GUI as well.

I have learned several things creating this.

1. PAY ATTENTION TO SCOPES
2. Remember to reassign variables within the function
3. How to write a while loop
4. run if...else functions with multiple parameters
